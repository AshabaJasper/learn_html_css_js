// The Assignment Operator (=) assigns a value to a variable
// For example
let b = 10; 
// This assigns b to the value 10

// More examples
// Assign the value 5 to x
let x = 5;
// Assign the value 2 to y
let y = 2;
// Assign the value x + y to z:
let z = x + y;

// 2. Addition Assignment Operators       +=
    // The "+=" operator in Javascript is called the Addition Assignment Operator.
//  It adds the right operand to the left operand and then assigns the result to the left operand.
    //   For example:

var c = 10; 
c += 5; 



// 3. Subtraction Assignment Operators    -=
    // The subtraction assignment operator "-" in Javascript is used to subtract a value from a variable and assign the result back to the same variable.
    // The subtraction assignment operator can be represented as "-=".

    let r = 10;
r -= 5;
console.log(r); // Output: 5

// 4. Subtraction Assignment Operators    -=
// The subtraction assignment operator "-" in Javascript is used to subtract a value from a variable.
//  The subtraction assignment operator "-" can be written as "-" followed by "=". 
//  This operator performs the subtraction of the right-hand operand from the left-hand operand and assigns the result back to the left-hand operand.

// For example:
let k = 100;
k -= 50;
console.log(k); // Output: 50

    // 5. Multiplication Assignment Operators *=
// The multiplication assignment operator "*=" in Javascript is used to multiply a value to a variable.
//  The operator performs the multiplication of the right-hand operand with the left-hand operand and assigns the result back to the left-hand operand.

// For example:
let p = 10;
p *= 5;
console.log(x); // Output: 50


    // 6. Division Assignment Operators       /=
// The division assignment operator "/=" in Javascript is used to divide a variable by a value.
//  The operator performs the division of the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand and assigns the result back to the left-hand operand.
//  For example:
 let u = 50;
u /= 5;
console.log(u); // Output: 10

// 8. Exponential  Assignment Operators   **=
// The exponential assignment operator "**=" in Javascript is used to raise a variable to the power of a value. 
// The operator performs the exponentiation of the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand and assigns the result back to the left-hand operand.

// For example:

let v = 2;
v **= 3;
console.log(v); // Output: 8
