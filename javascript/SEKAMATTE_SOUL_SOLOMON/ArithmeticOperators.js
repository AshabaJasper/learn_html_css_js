// Arithmetic Operators

// Addition operator +
let count = 10
// an operator which allows you to add a new value to an already existing variable 
count + 1

// Subtraction operator -
let count1 = 10
// an operator which allows you to subtract a new value from an already existing variable 
count1 - 1

// Multiplication operator *
let count2 = 10
// an operator which allows you to multiply a new value with an already existing variable 
count2 * 2

// Division operator /
let count3 = 10
// an operator which allows you to divide an already existing variable by a new value 
count3 / 2

// Remainder operator %
let count4 = 10
// an operator which allows you to divide an already existing variable by a new value and return the remainder
count4 % 3

// Increment operator ++
let count5 = 10
// an operator allows you to add one to a variable 
count5 ++

// Decrement operator --
let count6 = 10
// an operator allows you to subtracct one from a variable 
count6 --

// Exponential operator **
let count7 = 10
// an operator allows you to get the variable to the power another number 
count7 ** 2
