Logical Operators in JavaScript 
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

Logical AND (&&)
The logical AND operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

Logical OR (||)
The logical OR operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Logical NOT (!)
The logical NOT operator (!) returns true if its single operand that can be of any type is false; otherwise, returns false.
