//Comparison operators are used to contrast between values 
//They usually return a boolean response ( true or false)

let z=8

//== compares z with a given value to see if it is equal or not
console.log(z==9) //Returns a false because its not true.

//=== compares z with the value and type of the other value 
console.log(z==="8") //Returns false because 8 is now a string not an integer like assigned above


//!= checks to see if z is not equal to a given value .
console.log(z!=7) //Returns true because z is not equal to 7 , z is equal to 8

//!== It will return true if either the type or value matches that of z (one of them should be true for it to return true)
console.log(z!==9) 

//> Used to compare if z is greater than a given value 
console.log(z>9) 

//> Used to compare if z is less than a given value 
console.log(z<4)

//>= Used to check if z is greater than or equal to a given value
console.log(z>=8)

//<= Used to check if z is less than or equal to a given value
