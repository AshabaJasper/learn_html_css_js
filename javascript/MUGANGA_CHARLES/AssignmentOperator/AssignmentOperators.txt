Assignment Operators in Javascript includes a number of operators that can be used to assign values to variables.
The most common assignment operator is the equal sign (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand.
That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.
The following table lists the assignment operators in JavaScript.
Assignment Operator Description 
Example

i) = Simple assignment operator.
x = y;

ii) += Add and assignment operator.
It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. 
x += y;

iii) -= Subtract and assignment operator.
It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
x -= y; 

iv) *= Multiply and assignment operator.
It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
x *= y;

v) /= Divide and assignment operator.
It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
x /= y; 

vi) %= Modulus and assignment operator.
It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
x %= y;

vii) <<= Left shift and assignment operator.
It shifts the left operand the specified number of bits to the left and assigns the result to the left operand.
x <<= y; 

xi) >>= Right shift and assignment operator.
It shifts the left operand the specified number of bits to the right and assigns the result to the left operand.
x >>= y; 

x) >>>= Unsigned right shift and assignment operator.
It shifts the left operand the specified number of bits to the right and assigns the result to the left operand.

x >>>= y; &= Bitwise AND and assignment operator.
It performs a bitwise AND on the left and right operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
x &= y; 

xi) ^= Bitwise XOR and assignment operator.
It performs a bitwise XOR on the left and right operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
x ^= y; 

xii)|= Bitwise OR and assignment operator. 
It performs a bitwise OR on the left and right operands and assigns the result to the left operand.
 x |= y;
