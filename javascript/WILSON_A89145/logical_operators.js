//&& logical operator
//This only returns true if both  conditions are true
let x = 10 ,y = 20
console.log(x == 10&&y == 20)

//|| logical operator
//This only returns false if both conditions are false
console.log(x > 5||y > 15) //Since x greater than 10 and y is greater than 15 , the result is true.


//! logical operator
//Returns the opposite or inverse  of the statement   

console.log(!(x == 10)) //returns false
