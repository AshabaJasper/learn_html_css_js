// ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

// Addition Assignment operator +=
let count = 10
console.log(`Original count = ${count}`)
// adding a new value to an already existing variable and assign the new value to the variable
count += 1
console.log(`New count = ${count}`)


// Subtraction Assignment operator -=
let count1 = 10
console.log(`Original count1 = ${count1}`)
// subtract a new value from an already existing variable and assign the new value to the variable
count1 -= 1
console.log(`New count1 = ${count1}`)


// Multiplication Assignment operator *=
let count2 = 10
console.log(`Original count2 = ${count2}`)
// Multiplying a new value with an already existing variable and assign the new value to the variable
count2 *= 2
console.log(`New count2 = ${count2}`)


// Division Assignment operator /=
let count3 = 10
console.log(`Original count3 = ${count3}`)
// dividing an already existing variable by a new value and assign the new value to the variable
count3 /= 2
console.log(`New count3 = ${count3}`)


//  Modulus Assignment operator %=
let count4 = 10
console.log(`Original count4 = ${count4}`)
// an assignment operator which allows you to divide an already existing variable by a new value and assign the remainder to the variable
count4 %= 3
console.log(`New count4 = ${count4}`)


// Exponential Assignment operator **=
let count5 = 10
console.log(`Original count5 = ${count5}`)
// getting the variable to the power another number and assign the new value to the variable
count5 **= 2
console.log(`New count5 = ${count5}`)
